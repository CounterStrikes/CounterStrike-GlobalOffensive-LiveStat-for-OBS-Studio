It's a basic addon and 100% open-source. I saw some unused variable while playing a match and will be added later. Also in the future, I try to convert this into a webpage. Maybe it act faster and works still without _myPHPadmin_ and _Apache_. Well, this script need **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**, because of Valve's API.

If you like it, please like and share this so everybody see it. If you want use this in your own project, please make sure there is a URL to this page and mention me. Feel free for a little **[Donation](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GLQ52YVTN24CN&source=url)**.

P.S. Maybe you don't know it already but I'm a little bit crazy ü§ì. If everything works like I expected, I'll add this feature as Watchface for this **[Social and Gaming Smartwatch](https://theamadeus25.github.io/LaColorduino/)**.

Maybe I create a full-room-ambilight which change colour depending of your in game health?? It need to transfer this Information to my Arduino/ESP8266 Microcontroller, which controls some RGB-LED-Strips. This would be epic and uniqe, kind of!
